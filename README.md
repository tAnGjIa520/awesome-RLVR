## Why RLVR?

RLVR couples reinforcement learning with **objective, externally verifiable signals**, yielding a training paradigm that is simultaneously powerful and trustworthy:

* **Ground-truth rewards** – unit tests, formal proofs, or fact-checkers provide binary, tamper-proof feedback.  
* **Intrinsic safety & auditability** – every reward can be traced back to a transparent verifier run, simplifying debugging and compliance.  
* **Strong generalization** – models trained on verifiable objectives tend to extrapolate to unseen tasks with minimal extra data.  
* **Emergent “aha-moments”** – sparse, high-precision rewards encourage systematic exploration that often yields sudden surges in capability when the correct strategy is discovered.  
* **Self-bootstrapping improvement** – the agent can iteratively refine or even generate new verifiers, compounding its own learning signal.  
* **Domain-agnostic applicability** – the same recipe works for code generation, theorem proving, robotics, games, and more.

## How does it work?

1. **Sampling.** We draw one or more candidate completions \( {a}_{1..k} \) from a policy model \( \pi_\theta \) given a prompt \( s \).  
2. **Verification.** A deterministic function \( r(s,{a}) \) checks each completion for correctness.  
3. **Rewarding.**  
   • If a completion is verifiably correct, it receives a reward \( r = \gamma \).  
   • Otherwise the reward is \( r = 0 \).  
4. **Policy update.** Using the rewards, we update the policy parameters via RL (e.g., PPO).  
5. **(Optional) Verifier refinement.** The verifier itself can be trained, hardened, or expanded to cover new edge cases.

Through repeated iterations of this loop, the policy learns to maximise the externally verifiable reward while maintaining a clear audit trail for every decision it makes.
